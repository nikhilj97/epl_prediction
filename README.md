This project looks to predict the outcome of English Premier League. There are 6 major factors which contribute to the result of the match, they are - Number of goals scored, Number of clean sheets kept, Shots on target made by the team, Shots taken from inside the box, Goals conceded, Saves made by the goalkeeper of the team. Ranking Algorithm helps to determine where a team stands comparative to other teams in the above mentioned departments. Use of Ranking Algorithm can also provide the team with their ranking in all these fields individually, so that they can figure out the departments which needs improvement and work on the same.  The final ranking of the teams in the table is determined on number of wins. Generally, team with highest number of wins ends up winning the league. “Goals” and “clean sheets” are the two factors on which “wins” is dependent. Both are directly proportional to wins. I.e. the more the number of goals scored and clean sheets kept, more are the chances of winning.  Furthermore, for determining “goals”, “shots on target” &amp; “shots from inside box”  are the two main factors; and for determining “clean sheets”, “goals conceded” &amp; “saves” are the factors. Analysis of all these factors leads us to predict the overall rank of the team, which also can be considered as the finishing position in the table at the end of the season.
